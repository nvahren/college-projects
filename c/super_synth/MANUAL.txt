User Manual for "super_synth.c"


The program "super_synth.c" uses many of the same inputs as Lab 8's "piano.c" 
and "synth.c."  However, "super_synth.c" no longer supports inputting notes, 
tempo changes, etc. from the command line and requires the user to create a 
separate text file such as "example.music" to contain their inputs.  Once 
the user has his or her input file, all he or she has to do is use the 
following execution command to generate a .wav file with their song:

./super_synth example.music example.wav

Note that the first filename is that of the input file and the second 
filename becomes the name of the .wav file.  Also note that the user can 
change "example.wav" to any other file name such as "example2.wav" 
to generate a new copy of his or her song.
